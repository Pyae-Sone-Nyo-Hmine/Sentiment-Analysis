6th.", "The two formal procedures are:\n\n1.", "Congress rescheduling or descheduling it.", "This was hardly worth even typing, congress doesn't pass shit at the moment.", "However, this will need to be done if congress ever wants to deschedule or tax weed.", "2.", "The current process done through the HHS and DEA.", "The current process being done has 3 major time consuming steps:\n\n1.", "HHS reviews the medical values of the drug and recommends a schedule (1-10 years)\n2.", "DEA also review the drug, and in the past has always come to the same conclusion as HHS (3 months to 5 years)

among Democrats/Independents/Republicans?", "The holidays.", "It gives some politics you can talk about with your family that is less likely to rip them apart than almost any other topic.", "The

already done by that point for it to be passed off 2 months later.", "No reason for him to make a prediction of \"hopefully this year\" at that point.", "That leads me to believe he was talking about

too hard for most of you, I'll summarize it:\n\n* Some people believe that the Controlled Substance Act (CSA) and an international treaty known as the \"Single Convention\" forces any drug in the Single Convention to be in Schedule 1 or 2 due to a court case before i was born.", "As seen by this rescheduling, this is not true.", "They realized they could reschedule it wherever they wanted as long as they made up random rules for the drugs if they put it in 3/4/5.", "\"control the drug in schedule III, IV, or V, and simultaneously amend the regulations to require a permit to import or export Epidiolex.\"", "Basically, as long as they told people they weren't allowed to import or export it they could reschedule it wherever they want.", "They will do this for weed as well.", "* Turns out, the part of the CSA that forces them to deal with international treaties allows them to **literally skip any part of the process they want**.", "\"Thus, in such circumstances, the Administrator is not obligated to request a medical and scientific evaluation\" and \"Thus, section 811(d)(1) expressly requires that this type of scheduling action not proceed through the notice-and-comment rulemaking procedures\".", "That means they can skip both the first and last steps if they wanted.", "They don't skip the HHS recommendation because then they'd have no clue where to put it, but for rulemaking you know what they said?", "They said fuck the last part of the process and straight up rescheduled it.", "You know what they are going to do with weed?", "Fuck the last part of the process.", "No one wants to have to deal with multiple months of hearings listening to how weed turned their kid away from god after he injected it into his veins.", "* When was the HHS recommendation presented in this case?", "\"HHS most recently updated its medical and scientific evaluation and scheduling recommendation for the Epidiolex formulation by letter to DEA dated June 13, 2018.\"", "When was the rescheduling done?", "\"Effective September 28, 2018.\"", "For those bad at dates, that's 107 days.", "107 days from weeds HHS recommendation will be December 15th.", "&#x200B;\n\n**4.", "**

to let investment companies start touching these stocks (no one is quite sure yet), bringing in a ton of capital.", "This is the only catalyst mentioned that actually impacts the fundamentals of the Canadian weed companies as it will also let them start trying to build up their companies in the USA as they are currently avoiding it due to needing to de-list from the Nasdaq if they try.", "**Earnings** \\- In the past couple of years, the majority of weed companies earnings have been absolutely atrocious.", "Most have been slowly turning it around this year, so we may see better than expected earnings come November, largely due to another state opening its market successfully this quarter.", "This will probably also fuck you over mid rally if you choose one of the shitty weed companies to invest in.", "# Targets\n\nHere is my own expectations of my \\~600k (now 1 Mil) investment based on what i think will happen:\n\n* **2 Mil (Bad Result)** \\- Basically nothing except

for the DD\u2026 I\u2019m going to KISS and break it into 3 parts: The Situation, The Opportunity and The Big Badaboom\n\n**The Situation:** NVAX and COVID\n\nI\u2019ve been digging into NVAX over the past week or so, and I truly think it has a remarkable set up given current headlines and the recent earnings report they delivered earlier this month.", "For those that don\u2019t know, NVAX is a

all we care about right now is the COVID vaccine.", "Why?", "Well people are freaking out again about COVID so you know that a) these types of tickers will be top of mind and B) NVAX is positioned to profit from their vaccine.", "Before moving forward, it\u2019s important to clear up some potential misconceptions.", "1.", "NVAX is \\*not\\* the same company from 2020/2021 that completely fucked up the opportunity in front of them.", "A new c-suite was brought in earlier this year and they\u2019ve been executing very well.", "What proof do I have?", "Well, they turn a surprise profit this past earnings (when the street expected EPS of worse that -$1.50).", "A \\*slight\\* improvement from prior year

I mentioned from last quarter was driven by ex-USA revenues.", "That\u2019s right, they made the majority of their business outside of the USA.", "Why?", "Well, their vaccine is still under review by the FDA but the timeline is for an expected decision sometime next month.", "The vaccine is currently being use/distributed under an EUA, so it stands to reason the approval should come along shortly.", "This unlocks a LARGE portion of the US demographic as a result.", "Big catalyst (upsies or downsies).", "Additionally, there is a new strain of COVID (shocker!)", "NVAX vaccine is already

wrong.", "Commonly, the \u201cFloat\u201d is calculated by the freely traded shares, which usually subtracts 13d/f/g filings from the outstanding share count.", "As of the latest earnings, the

accounted for via 13d/f/g.", "Yes yes yes, many of those parties can and do loan out shares.", "Regardless, it means a LOT of shares are spoken for and can easily be recalled if so desired.", "That puts the more accurate float around 35m shares.", "Also worth noting that some major holders are adding to their positions, like State street, who increased their 13g stake from around 6m to 10.4m\n\n[https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1000694/000009375123000558/NOVAVAX\\_INC.txt](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1000694/000009375123000558/NOVAVAX_INC.txt)\n\nSo if my calc above is a more accurate float (it might not be), then SI as a % of FF is closer to 113%.", "So why isn\u2019t this stock going apeshit right now?", "Well, again, many tute holders most likely are loaning out shares and earning yield.", "Very cool and very legal.", "Why might that change?", "Well, if something fundamentally changes, ie a vaccine being officially FDA approved, that might alter the dynamic.", "Also, a lot of mouth breathers are afraid of mRNA vaccines and the NVAX offering is differentiated from the MRNA/BNTX/PFE offering as it\u2019s the only protein-based vaccine.", "So

time to return a movie, a subscriber puts it back into the postage-paid mailers that came with and drops it into a mailbox with no shipping fees.", "*Forward thinking:* Netflix was investing in technology and consumers really liked the personalised recommendations by their software (Netflix recommends titles based on user's previous choices).", "Brick and Mortar stores like Blockbuster

products, the overall CAGR is held at about 2% for my entire forecast period.", "When forecasting Advertising revenue, SPOT plans on using Audiobooks, Podcast to increase advertising spend to improve advertising revenue.", "Rationale for this is that by giving larger audio offerings means MAU spends longer on the platform allowing for SPOT to earn more advertising revenue.", "But, as these
