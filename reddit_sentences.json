10 or 65.", "Then they invited university students in for an experiment.", "First, they spin the wheel, then had the student write down the number it landed on.", "Afterwards, Kahneman and Tversky

happened.", "In performing this exercise, you inoculate yourself against overconfidence and create opportunity to pre-empt future mistakes.", "* ***Loss Aversion***\n\nAt the core of many of our poor money choices lie loss aversion.", "The idea is that most people feel the loss of something far more acutely than they feel the gain.", "Through his research, Kaneman found that the ratio of loss

out.", "Waiting until we come upon an opportunity that offers 100% guarantee to make money means we'll never invest at all.", "** It may also mean we end up relying solely on bank deposits with returns that fail to keep up with inflation, an inevitable result of loss.", "Yes, it's likely that some investments will come out at a loss, but as long as you make more good investments than bad,

Risk***\n\nIn Kahneman and Tversky's Nobel Prize-winning theory called Prospect Theory, they posited that just as there are diminishing returns for gains, there is a similarly diminishing impact for

1.", "What's interesting is that this situation is entirely inverted in Problem 2.", "All of a sudden, people would prefer a 90% chance to lose $1,000 over a guaranteed loss of $900.", "The reason is

precisely the opposite.", "If we are guaranteed to lose $900, the loss of an additional $100 feels negligible.", "In exchange for the possibility of losing an additional $100, we gain a 10% chance to lose nothing at all, which has much greater psychological value.", "When it comes to losses, we are risk seeking.", "Why is this important?", "**Consider we purchased a stock for $80 a share and it has gone down to $30.", "We know the company is performing poorly and the economy is entering a recession.", "The odds that the stock will drop to $20 and stay at that price is 90%.", "The smart decision is to sell the stock at $30 and reinvest in another stronger company, but because we are risk seeking when faced with loss, we hold on to the stock for that slim 10% chance that it will bounce back to $80 a share.", "** This is the reason why we hold on to losing stocks and refuse to realize a loss.", "Selling now and losing $50 for sure feels much worse than a 90% chance to lose an
